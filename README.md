# Property-js

#### Currently a work-in-progress right now, Property.js is a small but powerful Javascript library that allows you to easily manipulate anything on the canvas. Eventually, Property.js will be compatible with other Javascript libraries like jQuery, p5.js, and others libraries that aren't called React.

> #### If you are interested in the development of Property.js, or would like to help out in its development, just contact me at alan.invents@gmail.com.
